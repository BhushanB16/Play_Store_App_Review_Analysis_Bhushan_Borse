Play_Store_App_Review_Analysis

Project Summary -
The objective of this project was to analyze the Google Play Store data to gain insights about the app market and provide recommendations to help businesses achieve their objectives on the platform. The analysis involved examining various app attributes such as categories, ratings, reviews, price, size, installs, and type.

The dataset was first preprocessed to clean and transform the data to ensure its usability for analysis. The cleaning process involved removing missing values, converting data types, and handling outliers. The transformed dataset was then used to conduct data visualization and storytelling using various charts such as bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.

The analysis revealed that the most popular app categories on the Play Store were Family, Game, and Dating. The data also showed that the rating and number of reviews had a positive correlation, which suggests that higher-rated apps tended to have more reviews. Moreover, the majority of the apps on the Play Store were free, and paid apps tended to have fewer downloads.

The analysis also indicated that app size had a weak negative correlation with installs, which suggests that smaller apps were more likely to be downloaded. Additionally, the heatmap showed a positive correlation between installs and ratings, indicating that higher-rated apps had more downloads. The pair plot analysis further confirmed these findings and showed the distribution of various app attributes.

Based on the analysis, it is recommended that businesses develop free apps with smaller sizes to increase their chances of downloads. Moreover, businesses should focus on improving their app ratings as higher-rated apps tend to have more downloads. Additionally, it is recommended that businesses should focus on developing apps in the popular categories such as Family, Games, and Tools, as they have the highest market share on the platform.

The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses to develop effective app strategies and achieve their objectives on the Play Store. By considering the recommendations provided, businesses can increase their chances of success on the platform by creating apps that are more likely to be downloaded by users.

Overall, the analysis of the Play Store dataset provided valuable insights into the app market, and the recommendations provided can help businesses to create successful apps and achieve their objectives on the platform.
